# Hotel-Revenue-Dataset

The hotel revenue dataset contains the revenue of hotels in different tables for different arrival years and tables for meal costs and discounts for different customers. The tables are joined in SQL and the data is analyzed in PowerBI. 

The data analysis was done to answer three questions:

1. To check if the Hotel Revenue is growing by year? \
-- From the line plot for revenue, the trendline shows that revenue is increasing by the year
   
2. To check if the parking lot size needs to be increased? \
-- There is no significant increase in the percentage of total guests needing parking. So an increase in parking lot size is not necessary.
   
3. What trends can be seen in the data? \
-- Increasing trend is seen in adr(charge per night) and total nights spent by a customer
